# HEIMDALL

this project used a number of different sources for the purposes of Orbital
Calculations.

"Rocket and Space Technology", Robert A. Braeunig
Information used from this website includes equations and concepts
for calculating elliptcal orbit speeds, directions, angles, and 
calculation of the Hohmann Transfer Orbit.

NASA Glenn Research Center
As a project relating to rocket science, the information we were
able to find online through NASA's Glenn Research Center was vital
to this project being completed.  The specific information we
used from here were the equations for the Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation
(Ideal Rocket Equation), and the equations for Specific Impulse and 
Equivalent Exit Velocity.

NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory
This source was our initial exposure to the Hohmann Transfer Orbit,
and its specific application as a way for spacecraft to reach other
planets without using a lot of fuel.

Table of Integrals
This was a helpful resource since the initial forms of many of the
equations we used were in a form that required integration to be
used.
